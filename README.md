# Image-and-Text-Preproessing

Here, basic reading of Image is done using glob and skimage APIs. And the image is then converted to picels, and from tuples to flat.

APIs used for image preprocessing:
1. glob
2. skimage
3. matplotlib
4. PIL

Almost, all text preprocessing methods are shown here, like, setence and word tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, lowercase, removing hyperlinks, changing numbers to words, removing words etc.

APIs used for text preprocessing:
1. nltk
2. html
3. re (Regular Expressions)
4. nltk.tokenize
5. nltk.corpus (for stopwords)
6. inflect (to convert numbers to words)
7. PorterStemmer (for stemming)
8. WordNetLemmatizer (for lemmatization)

Hope this helps the ones in need.
